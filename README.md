## 📖 Description

The Waiter-App-API is an API developed in Node.js that was created to manage the ordering process in a restaurant. The purpose of the API is to provide an easy-to-use interface for customers to place orders and for restaurant staff to manage those orders.

The API was built using the Express.js framework, which is a popular choice for building APIs in Node.js. In addition, the API uses the MongoDB database to store order information.
